# Shopper Intention Prediction

This is the project repo for grad-level Machine Learning (now Statistical Learning) class at Northeastern University. 

## Project Abstract
This project attempts to predict whether browsing sessions on an e-commerce site byusers will successfully convert into purchase and generate revenue, based on various properties of the browsing session. To accomplish this, the steps taken were performing exploratory analysis on the dataset, conducting necessary preprocessing work, training several classification models, including logistic regression, K-NN, soft-margin support vector machine and neural networks. Finally, the performances of each model were evaluated to pick out the best ones. The final results were further explored to generate insights.

**Note**: Except for the NN model, all other models were built _from scratch_ **without** using existing Python ML libraries like scikit-learn. For neural network, TensorFlow were used.
